Code written by Google Gemini !  Wow.   

Uses the SPI GPIO functions to blink an 8x8 WS2812B  LED grid !  

I am amazed.  

I tried with python3, rpi_ws281x ( obviously did not work as it was written for the chip they use )

There is no "proprietary" Rockchip linux drivers/code for it either.  

Uses the MOSI pin for the SPI-0 overlay.  

C-Code only - GCC >> (file.name)  done.  

It should work with any SPI Boards.  Speed set to 6400000Hz.

Now for some patterns...
