This is a cross/compiled binary driver made with the LuckFox SDK on an x86 machine.  
Target is ARM Cortex-A7 / Luckfox  Pico Max  -  requires POS LCD I have three of to work. 
The oroginal drivers ARE available and there are/should be copies in this Git-Hub user somewhere..  

see here for the C code for the LCD to show text..  has specific driver calls in C.   works but I had to peoce it together.  Actually.... AI  wrote a cool program using the driver source as input ... AFTER I had spent all the time to figure it all out..  ;-)
